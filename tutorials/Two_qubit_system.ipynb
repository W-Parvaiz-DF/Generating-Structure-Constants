The code here only allows for the construction of the (tensored) Pauli basis generator, for dimensions which are of the form $N = 2^{k}$ e.g. $k$-qubit systems. This is because we show in appendix D of [(citationneed)], that the commutation and anticommutation of elements in the corresponding Lie group are not linear combination of other elements and hence the antisymmetric, $f_{jkl}$ and symmetric, $g_{jkl}$ structure constants (respectively) are easier to compute. Furthermore, we showed in Theorem [FIND] that in these scenarios, all the parameters of the Hamiltonian, $\\theta_i$, can be recovered. \n",

From this, the property of kossakowski matrix being is carried forward into this class and from this, either ```build_general_matrix()``` method or the ```build_symetric_matrix()``` method is invoked producing a matrix of shape $(n^{2}, n^{2})$ or $(n^{2}, n(n+1)/2)$. Note that for the symmetric case, in the paper we refer to this matrix as $T_3$ however, here we simple keep the class the same and refer to it as $T_2$. In this case, we get $T_3$ which is a matrix with shape $(225, 120)$. One can check the rank by calling the property ```.rank``` or check if the matrix is full rank directly by calling ```isfullrank()``` which returns a boolean value. Here, we get the output ```True``` which tells us that the environmental parameters of the system are recoverable.   "
